# TidyShot

A macOS menu bar screenshot tool. Capture an area, a window, or a display; it is saved as a
Retina-correct PNG, copied to the clipboard, and uploaded to your own S3-compatible bucket
with the URL on your clipboard.

Requires macOS 26 or later.

## Build

```bash
brew install xcodegen
xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project TidyShot.xcodeproj -scheme TidyShot -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath .build build
open .build/Build/Products/Debug/TidyShot.app
```

Or open `TidyShot.xcodeproj` in Xcode after `xcodegen generate`.

## Test

```bash
xcodebuild -project TidyShot.xcodeproj -scheme TidyShot -destination 'platform=macOS' -derivedDataPath .build test
```

## Permissions

TidyShot needs Screen Recording permission (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen & System
Audio Recording). With ad-hoc signing (the default), macOS asks again after every rebuild. To avoid that,
sign in to Xcode with an Apple ID, then switch to Apple Development signing:

```bash
cp Config/Local.xcconfig.example Config/Local.xcconfig
```

Edit `Config/Local.xcconfig` to set `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = Apple Development` and your
`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`, then run `xcodegen generate` again.

## Default shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Capture area | ⌃⇧4 |
| Capture window | ⌃⇧2 |
| Capture fullscreen | ⌃⇧3 |

Change them in Settings > Shortcuts.

## Upload

Settings > Upload takes an S3-compatible endpoint (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, MinIO),
region, bucket, a public URL template such as `https://snap.tky.io/{key}`, and an object key
template. Credentials are stored in your login keychain; Forget Credentials removes them again.
Save and Test Connection saves the form, then uploads a small probe object into the folder your
key template would use, fetches it through the public URL without credentials, and deletes it.

The key template defaults to `{random:6}` (`aSIS7x.png`). Tokens: `{date}` `{year}` `{month}`
`{day}` `{time}` `{datetime}` `{hostname}` `{counter}` `{random}` `{random:N}`; letters,
digits, `.`, `_`, `-` and `/` are allowed between tokens, and `/` makes folders, so
`shots/{year}/{month}/{hostname}-{random:8}` is valid. The same tokens work in the file name
template. The app checks that a key is unused before uploading; a template without `{random}` or
`{counter}` gets a warning, because captures can then produce the same key and only that check
keeps an upload from overwriting an earlier object. By default no
ACL header is sent; turn on "Send public-read ACL" only if your bucket relies on object ACLs
rather than a bucket policy or CDN.

After capture, "Upload and copy URL" saves the file locally first, then uploads it; the public
URL replaces the clipboard contents when the upload finishes. "Upload only, keep no local file"
writes the PNG inside TidyShot's container instead, uploads it, copies the URL and deletes the
file; a failed upload keeps it until a retry succeeds or the capture is deleted.

## Recent Captures

Hover Recent Captures in the menu bar menu for the newest 15 captures, each with a thumbnail, its
name and how long ago it was taken. Click a row to copy its URL (or the file when it was never
uploaded). The row's buttons copy the URL, copy the image (downloaded from the bucket with a
signed request when no local file is left), or delete the capture. Hover a thumbnail to see the
capture full size beside the menu.

Delete asks once, "Delete this capture?", then removes the object from the bucket it was uploaded
to, the local file, the thumbnail and the history entry. If the bucket refuses the delete, a
second alert offers to remove the capture from history anyway and leave the object where it is.
The Quick Access overlay has the same Delete; while an upload is still running it cancels it
first. Retry Failed Uploads appears in the menu whenever an upload has failed.
Thumbnails live in `~/Library/Containers/io.tky.tidyshot/Data/Library/Application Support/TidyShot/thumbnails`.
